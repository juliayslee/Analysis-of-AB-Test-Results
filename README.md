### Introduction:
A/B tests are very commonly performed by websites, our goal is to work through some questions and help the e-commerce company understand if they should implement the new page, keep their old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision

### Part I - Probability:
Read in all libraries as well as our dataset. Assess our dataset using descriptive pandas tools to see what we're working with! Probability analysis of the users "converting" to the new page, answering "does the new page result to more converted users, and if so, by how much?

### Part II - A/B Test:
Stating our null and alternative hypothesis based on assuming the old page is better unless proven that the new page is. Calculating p-values, comparing to a 0.05 Type I error rate, z-values etc. to help make our conclusion.

### Part III - Regression:
As our case only has 2 predicting outcomes, we use logistic regression to perform our analysis. 

Finishing with our conclusion and limitations.
